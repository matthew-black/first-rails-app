  content: "Hello. I have Pokemon Red. I am looking for someone who has Pokemon Blue. I have the link cable and it would be fun to make trades. I think you can get stronger Pokemon if you switch em from the games.

Also, some Pokemon are only in one of the games. I really want a Vulpix and a Sandshrew for example."

This is so so awesome. I hated playing tennis with my glasses on, and all of the high-school kids made fun of me and called me banana. (That was not related to the glasses and it was because during a team huddle coach asked what we should all yell at the end and I said 'banana' but whatever all those guys drink AND are twice my size and I almost beat Derek our number one player during the seeding tournament. Actually though, I didn't like being called banana.)"

She was happy about that. And then she went back to pushing her toy shopping cart around the house trying to sell us sour gummy worms and other kinds of candy for a nickel each.

I can't even wait to have a dog!"

  title: "Graffiti Island",
  content: "So this majorly bugs me. We always like to ride our bikes under the overpass to get behind Leach Park where some teenagers made this big BMX course.

I guess that people keep calling the police because the same teenagers who made the awesome BMX course are also making lots of graffiti and leaving beer cans there. Anyway my neighbor Zac told me that the city (or the police?) or something might go and wreck the BMX stuff because it's getting expensive to keep painting over graffiti all the time. (If I was a teenager I'd just do more graffiti if they wrecked my sweet bike trail...)

I don't know why they even need to paint over it. It looks kinda cool. But I spose sometimes they paint big dicks and 'fucks' and stuff. (I think it's someone else who does that though. Most of the spray paint stuff is way more like art type stuff.) But it's not like anyone except for them is ever hanging out back there. Like you won't even see that stuff if you aren't one of the teenagers who hang out there. The trains go by so fast there's no way that the they can see anything...

In conclusion, please do not mess with the BMX trial."

  title: "I am quitting piano lessons.",
  content: "Yep. Finally. Trumpet is ACTUALLY something I like doing so the deal is if I keep practicing trumpet it's okay if I stop doing piano.

I LOVE trumpet. My school has a jazz band and that music is so much fun. I just get to play loud and hopefully I can learn more high notes because there are LOTS of them. (I'm only third chair, but there's a 12th grader that can play As and Bs!)

We even have one song where the 1st trumpet is supposed to play a HIGH E at the end. But he can't really go above A. I mean, even when he does get an A or B it sounds like crap (but you did not hear that from me).

I guess this turned out to be more of a story about trumpet.

OH ALSO! Next summer I am going to go to jazz band camp in Canada with Michael. I get to play jazz ALL WEEK and we even get to learn how to improvise!"

  title: "Please snow so much soon.",
  content: "I made a plan. The next time it's supposed to blizzard, I'm going to rent ALL the Star Trek movies from Video Magic. It seems like I only ever rent PlayStation games there, but they have all six of the original movies PLUS Generations (with Captain Kirk and Captain Picard!) and First Contact.

Yep. That's 8 movies. But if I am lucky and the blizzard is on a Wednesday I can rent seven movies for $7 on Tuesdya. So it will be less than ten bucks and I can just sit eat popcorn all day and take breaks to jump off the house if the snowbanks get huge enough.

That's alot of movies though. Maybe no house jumping if I'm seriously gonna watch them all.

I am going to watch them all.

Love,
Matt

P.S. They better all be rewinded. The last time I rented The Rock it seemed like I had to wait like five hours for our crappy VCR to rewind it."

  title: "The coolest books ever!",
  content: "Everyone! These books are so good. They're called Star Wars Young Jedi Knights. There about Jacen and Jaina who are Han and Leia's kids. They're both getting Jedi training from Luke, and they eventually get to build their own lightsabers and everything.

They have all of them at the library. Unless I have all of them checked out haha. But really, if you're reading this and you like Star Wars you have to read one. The first one is called Heirs of the Force.

I don't want to ruin any surprises about it. But it all happens on Yavin 4 where Luke has started a Jedi Academy, and so many things all happen that have to do with a crashed TIE Fighter."

I've had this site for almost a year now, but they all say October. Hmm.

Does anyone know what's going on?"
